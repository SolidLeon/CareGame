Update 1

- Tree saplings 'item' should be something like acorn or other form of sseds, but not the actual TREES!!!
- Colors are bit gray... grass should look rich green
- Player needs Animations:
  * Smash/use
  * Walk
- Water must FLOW - if you dig a hole tile next to a water tile, the hole tile gets flooded.
- Tile watering should be slower, and a little bit random, instead of being
  watered instantly as soon as a water/water hole tile is next to it.
    Technically almost not doable since we have no seperated seed tile where the farmland underneath can be watered.
    Attempts were made, but failed due to insufficient bits to get a smooth aging AND wetting.
- Rain should water tiles.
    WORKS!!!

----------

5x5 squares
need to care about these fields

each field must be watered, fertilized enough to keep
health level good

goal is to keep them healthy until they grow fully.



start out with one seed.
plant it onto one square.
Watering and fertilizing it one time to start growing.
A water tear symbolizes that the crop needs water,
a green tear symbolizes that it needs to be fertilized.
